She eats 3 eggs for breakfast, and bakes 4 eggs into muffins, so she has 16 - 3 - 4 = 9 eggs left. She sells these 9 eggs at the farmers' market for $2 per egg, so she makes 9 x 2 = #### 18", "passed": 1, "fmt_err": 0}

How many bolts in total does it take?\nA:", "generation": "A: First, I need to find out how many bolts of white fiber are needed. Since it's half the amount of blue fiber, and there are 2 bolts of blue fiber, I can divide 2 by 2 to get the number of bolts of white fiber. 2 \u00f7 2 = 1. So, it takes 1 bolt of white fiber. Then, I need to add the number of bolts of blue fiber and white fiber to find the total number of bolts. 2 (blue) + 1 (white) = 3. #### 3", "passed": 1, "fmt_err": 0}
