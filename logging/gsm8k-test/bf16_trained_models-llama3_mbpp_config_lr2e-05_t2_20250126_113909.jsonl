Then, she eats 3 eggs for breakfast, and bakes muffins with 4 eggs, so she uses a total of 3 + 4 = 7 eggs. That leaves 16 - 7 = 9 eggs for her to sell at the farmers' market. She sells each egg for $2, so she makes 9 x 2 = #### 18", "passed": 1, "fmt_err": 0}

This increased the value of the house by 150%.  How much profit did he make?\nA: First, we need to find the new value of the house after the repairs. We can do this by multiplying the original value by the percentage increase: $80,000 x 150% = $80,000 x 1.5 = $120,000. This means the house is now worth $120,000. To find the profit, we subtract the cost of the house and the repairs from the new value: $120,000 - $80,000 - $50,000 = $30,000. #### 30000", "passed": 0, "fmt_err": 0}
